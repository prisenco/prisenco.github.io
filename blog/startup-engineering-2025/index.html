            <h4>Welcome to halfway through 2025!</h4>
            <p>
              This marks 18 months since I moved to New York City. I was
              familiar with the city before moving, having visited repeatedly
              over the years but this is the first I've lived here properly.
            </p>
            <p>
              What have I learned about the city since then? Most importantly,
              networking here is a breeze. There's a highly social and ambitious
              culture but unlike other tech hubs, the economy here is
              diversified. Every industry in the world exists right here. That
              means the startup scene is filled with innovative ideas grounded
              in real world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              And of course I have to point out that walking or taking a subway
              15 minutes to a networking event in a Manhattan bar beats an hour
              and a half in traffic to drive to Pasadena any day of the week.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're in NYC and a tech startup founder and want to meet up
              and talk shop, get in touch!
            </p>
            <h4>What I do as a startup engineering contractor</h4>
            <p>
              After a few years off, I've been back to contract work and it
              feels like going home. Some people love the stability of full time
              employment but give me the chaos of early stage startups any day.
            </p>
            <p>
              My expertise is in early stage startup or a greenfield projects
              and moving quickly to build a viable product or prototype while
              setting up the tech infrastructure necessary for success. I can
              act as a one-man team while founders build their actual team,
              writing code of course, but also setting up servers or cloud
              infrastructure, key management and documentation, and running
              interviews and making recommendations for hires.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't take equity so for equity-conscious founders it's a great
              way to start building momentum in the early days.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've also moved to a full-time contract model, charging a flat fee
              by the week instead of an itemized hourly rate. I've found that
              startups always have plenty to do and nobody likes filling out
              itemized invoices anyways. And I'm not sure anyone reads anything
              more than the bottom line anyways.
            </p>
            <p>
              So billing is simple and I'm available for ~45 hours a week.
              Startups can see me as effectively a founding engineer, which can
              make the transition to an actual founding engineer seemless.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not in the market for a contractor but know someone who is? I
              offer a commission / finder's fee for a direct introduction that
              leads to a contract.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's an offer that's good for a lifetime. Even if a contract isn't
              signed for a 1, 5, 10, 20 years from now, I keep records of how I
              meet a client and will find you and get you paid.
            </p>
            <h4>What I'm up to right now</h4>
            <p>
              I just wrapped up a contract so I'm taking a couple months
              off-contract to work on personal projects. Another small joy of
              contracting!
            </p>
            <p>
              I've been on a self-education kick with two great resources:
              <a href="https://www.mathacademy.com">Math Academy</a> and Casey
              Muratori's
              <a href="https://www.computerenhance.com/p/table-of-contents"
                >Performance Aware Programming</a
              >
              series.
            </p>
            <p>
              Math Academy is a fantastic resource. I'm 80% of the way through
              Math Foundations III and excited to move on to Mathematics for
              Machine Learning. I'll write more in the future but so far I can't
              recommend it enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              Casey Muratori's course is about getting back to the kind of low
              level programming that I cut my teeth on when I first started
              programming. I learned how to code in the demoscene in the 90's,
              writing C and assembly language on a 386 computer and measuring
              everything in clock cycles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web dev treats that as outdated and unnecessary. And maybe it is.
              But going back to understanding and writing code at the CPU level
              is like going home and a refocus on the low level fundamentals
              makes everyone a better programmer.
            </p>
            <h4>Simplify, simplify, simplify</h4>
            <p>
              I've been on simplification kick. As the industry has barrelled
              towards greater complexity, it's important we consider ways we can
              approach problems with the simplest solutions possible. For me,
              this means going all in on Golang, a small but performant language
              that has managed to stick to a philosophy of simplicity for over
              15 years. I've also returned to html and css, both of which have
              advanced considerably since the early days of SPA frameworks. And
              I've fallen in love with Sqlite as a rock solid, highly performant
              database engine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modern web tech frameworks are extremely complicated. Whether
              they're over-complicated or just complicated enough is up for
              debate but there's always room to step back and ask ourselves, how
              can we accomplish this in the simplest way possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              More on all of this soon enough but for now if you're in the
              startup scene get in touch and let's build.
